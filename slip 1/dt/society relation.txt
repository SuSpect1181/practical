: According to the question consider three nodes with labels
1. person(label)
2. place(label)
3. project(label)
To create node with the label and properties : 
create (ajay:person{name:"ajay",place : "pune",project:"finance",age:45}) 
return ajay
Explanation : we can crete the node with keyword CREATE. here ajay is a node 
name with label person and having the properties like name,place, project and 
age and i am going to return node ajay with RETURN keyword.
like wise i have created some other nodes 
create (anil:person{name:"anil",place : "mumbai",project:"inventory",age:25})
return anil
create (akash:person{name:"akash",place : "kolhapur",project:"sales",age:35}) 
return akash
create (amar:person{name:"amar",place : "pune",project:"sales",age:35}) return 
amar
create (alankar:person{name:"alankar",place : "pune",project:"sales",age:35}) 
return alankar
create (sunil:person{name:"sunil",place : "mumbai",project:"sales",age:22}) 
return sunil
create (sujit:person{name:"sujit",place : "mumbai",project:"finance",age:55}) 
return sujit
create (soham:person{name:"soham",place 
:"mumbai",project:"finance",age:65}) return soham
To See the Graph of all nodes which we have created using the MATCH and 
RETURN keyword
match (n) return (n)
Like wise we are going to create other nodes with label project
create (finance:project{name:"finance"}) return finance
create (inventory:project{name:"inventory"}) return inventory
create (sales:project{name:"sales"}) return sales
match (n) return (n)
Like wise we are going to create other nodes with label place
create (pune:place{name:"pune"}) return pune
create (mumbai:place{name:"mumbai"}) return mumbai
create (kolhapur:place{name:"kolhapur"}) return kolhapur
match (n) return (n)
Now we have to crete the relation between the nodes that we have created
match(a:person),(b:project) where a.name="soham" and b.name="inventory" 
create (a)-[r:works_in]-> (b) return a,b,r
here a,b is the variable name and using the create (a)-[r:works_in]-> (b) we are 
goin to create the relation between nodes soham and inventory and then to see 
the result use the RETURN 
like wise
match(a:person),(c:place) where a.name="soham" and c.name="pune" create 
(a)-[r:lives_in]-> (c) return a,c,r
create relation between all the nodes like this only.
Queries:
1. to return all the nodes having label person
match (p:person) return (p)
2. List the names of people who are parents.
match (p1:person)-[r:parent_of]-> (p2:person) return p1,p2,r
3. List the names of people working on â€˜Financeâ€˜ project
match (p:person ) where p.project="finance" return p
4. List the names of people having most friends.
match (p1:person)-[r:friend_of]-> (p2:person) return p1,p2,r
